Group Aphrodite
Proposed Project: Gradebook Management System

Functionalities:
- allows user to input a student's name and grades in the system
- displays entered data
- automatically computes grade average, identifies pass/fail, and ranks highest to lowest
- allows user to reset the system, deleting all recorded data
- allows user to delete chosen student record, erasing a row at a time


I. Introduction: 
As students, the group has seen teachers struggle with grading the tests and activities of hundreds of students. Teachers would have access to different apps like Google Sheets, however, they would need to code it first before using it. That said, the pair has decided to create an app that could hopefully help teachers easily grade their students. The suggested app asks the user to simply enter the student’s name and grades, then it will immediately compute the average grade, identify if it is passing or failing, and rank the students from highest scorer to lowest. The  app, unlike Google Sheets or Excel, would not require the user to code it before usage. This app can be of great assistance to teachers, especially new teachers since they would not have an existing gradebook system. New teachers will be able to save a fairly large amount of time coding by using this app. The app’s main selling point is its ease of use since there is no coding and formulas involved. Teachers would simply need to enter data and the system automatically does its functions.

The goal of the propsed app is to help make the grading system of teachers easier. It aims to assist teachers in efficiently and accurately grading the hundreds of students they handle daily. Since it aims to assist professors, this app includes features such as average grade computation, pass/fail identifier, and ranking system. 


II. Methodology: 
The team will utilize MATLAB Online in creating this proposed app. The pair will first decide on what their user interface will do, what features it will have. Then, they will decide on what components they need, and after, arrange it accordingly into the user interface. The pair will appropriately select the components that would need callbacks added. After, the team will code each function that needs coding. 


III. Deliverables: 
Time Table: 
October 16 - October 22: Brainstorming of Project Ideas
October 23: Approved Project Proposal
October 24 - November 5: Further Research on Approved Topic
November 6 - November 12: Creation of Project Proposal Paper
November 13: Submission of Paper Proposal
November 14 - November 24: Creation of Codes
November 25 - November 30: Integrating Codes
December 1 - December 3: Revisions
December 4: Submission Day

As seen above, we have set a schedule of activities for the completion of this project. This schedule will allow us to see our goals clearly and assist us in reaching our goals. This will also provide us with a guide on what we need to do.

IV. Evaluation:
The team's gradebook system should allow the user to input a student's name and grades. The user will then press the 'SAVE' button and the data will be placed into a table. The system will then compute the quizzes's average and display it. The average grade will then be identified by the system as 'PASS' or 'FAIL'. The system will then rank the students from highest to lowest. All these informatio will show onto the 6-column table on the user interface.
